        This will be a survival server released for Minecraft version 1.19.2 for Java Edition and will also be joinable from the latest Bedrock Edition. The only real reason for version 1.12.2 is that it makes everything easier for me and should provide a good gaming experience. I aim to create a lobby world for players to load into that'll have minigames and links for resources here at Oregon State. As I come up with server rules and updates, this page will be updated so check in occasionally so see what's going on.
