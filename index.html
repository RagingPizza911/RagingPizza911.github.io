        This will be a survival server released for any Minecraft 1.19 version for Java Edition and will also be joinable from the latest Bedrock Edition. I aim to create a lobby world for players to load into that'll have minigames and links for resources here at Oregon State. As I come up with server rules and updates, this page will be updated so check in occasionally so see what's going on.

        Go Beavs!
